Youtube Downloader Perl Script

download videos and even convert them to mp3 or ogg



Why use wget to download YouTube videos ?

    Normally, when you want to watch a Youtube video you have to use Adobe Flash in a browser like Firefox,
    Chrome (Chromium), Opera or Safari. We do not like this limitation as Flash is incredibly inefficient, a
    huge security hole and notoriously buggy. We like to watch videos in VLC which uses less CPU time and can
    play videos at higher than 1x speeds. In fact, we watch almost all of our vids at 2x.

    We also prefer a simpler scripted solution that does not rely on too many dependencies or proprietary code.
    For example, youtube-dl requires Python libraries and others require Javascript, Greesemonkey or even PHP
    to work in Firefox. Simple is better to audit and modify when needed.



    Latest Version: 0.30

      □ Youtube made changes in December of 2012 which randomized the URL on the HTML page. This required a
        rework of the perl search and replace code.
      □ The script is compatible with native IPv6 clients connecting to either IPv4 or IPv6 youtube servers.
        This is true for native IPv6 to IPv6 networks or even if you are using a IPv6 tunnel.



Advantages of a scripted solution

    AdBlock Plus and NoScript safe, No flash needed: To download the Youtube video just cut and paste the URL
    from the browser's URL bar. You do not need to start the video or anything. In fact, if you have NoScript
    you do not even have to allow java script on the Youtube site. You just need the link and paste it after
    the script. Simple and easy.

    Unlimited download speed: There are no download rate limits with the URL we extract from the HTML page. The
    videos will download as fast as the Youtube cache server will send the data. The speed primarily depends on
    the popularity of the video; the most asked for videos are put on the highest bandwidth cache servers.
    Using a testing server on Linode (Xen VPS Hosting) we easily saw 24 megabytes per second downloads. The
    maximum upload and download limits on a Linode server is 45 megabytes per second. BTW, Linode gets a 10 out
    of 10 for overall quality in our opinion.

    No Advertisements: The script will _not_ download any ads or advertisements like what you would see if you
    used the browser to watch flash videos. The reason is the ads are not part of the video, but a flash
    overlay Youtube inserts. We do not do anything to remove the ads at all. When you see an ad on Youtube the
    video is actually paused and the advertisement is overlaid on top of the video window. When the ad finishes
    the overlay is removed and video is unpaused.



The Youtube Download Perl script

    The youtube download script is written in Perl and can be run on Linux, Mac OSX, OpenBSD, FreeBSD or any
    operating system supporting perl. Since we are using perl the UNIX shell you use, like bash, tcsh, csh or
    sh does not matter. There is only one dependency you need to have installed on your system; the system
    binary "wget". Wget is incredibly useful not only for this perl script, but for any scripting you may do on
    the future. BTW, the standard wget package will allow you to download videos using HTTP or HTTPS. To make
    it easy we included the following lines to install these packages using your OS's package manager.

        ## Ubuntu Linux
        apt-get install wget

        ## FreeBSD
        pkg_add -r wget
            OR
        pkg install wget

        ## OpenBSD
        pkg_add -i wget

    To use the script, copy and paste the block of perl code from the following text box to a file. We are
    going to call the script youtube_get_videos.pl for this example, but you can name it anything you like.
    Remember to make the file executable too, "chmod 755 youtube_get_videos.pl".

    #!/usr/bin/perl

    use strict;
    use warnings;

Running the youtube_get_videos.pl script

    Once you have the script setup you just need to find a Youtube video. We chose a link from Tobygames
    showing a funny moment in Fallout 3: New Vegas which is 1 minute and 10 seconds long. Execute the script
    with the youtube URL copy and pasted from Firefox's URL bar. Make note you can add one more argument to the
    end of the command line to add a prefix to the file name. Here is an example of both options; notice the
    change in files names as the second example has "toby_" as the file name prefix. Also note some of the URLS
    through youtube have ampersands "&" in them. For these types of URL's just use double quotes around the url
    so your shell passes the full string into the script.

    ## Example 1: Here we just pass the youtube URL
    #
    user@machine$ ./youtube_get_videos.pl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejkm5uGoxs4

         Download: radscorpion.webm


    ## Example 2: Here we pass the Youtube URL and the file name prefix "toby_"
    #
    user@machine$ ./youtube_get_videos.pl http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejkm5uGoxs4 toby_

         Download: toby_radscorpion.webm


    The video will download in the background and save to your current directory. You can play it with your
    favorite video player, we prefer VLC for example.



Notes on how the script works

    File name is the same as the name of the web page: Notice the file name is the same as the title of the
    Youtube web page. We have also scrubbed the title to take out all special characters and reduce all letters
    to lower case. This makes it easier read and to run on the command line.

    Only the highest video quality: The script works by reducing the YouTube link's HTML code to just the URL
    to download the video. We have setup the script to only download the highest quality video available. The
    qualities will be 1080p, 720p or 480p respectively.

    Save Location: The video will be saved in your current directory.

    Script methodology: The wget line will run in the background. You can start as many of these downloads as
    you want. We have started as many as a dozen simultaneous downloads without issue. The script will finish
    silently; meaning when the download is finished you will not get any notification.

    Wget process state: You can check if the download is running by looking at the process list (ps) and
    grep'ing for wget. Something like, ps -aux | grep wget will work. At this point there is no way to tell how
    fast the download is going. What you can do is look at the file size change using ls -la and estimate from
    there. You can start watching the video file right away too. The file is downloaded serially, so as soon as
    the file starts downloading you should be able to start VLC if want to watch the video right away.

    Video file type: The video format will be WebM which is also called VP8. WebM is a digital multimedia
    container file format promoted by the open-source WebM Project headed by Google. It comprises a subset of
    the Matroska multimedia container format. If you current media player does not support webm then you need a
    codec for your OS. Just search on Google for "webm codec" and you should get pointed in the right
    direction. Note, you can play this format with the VLC media player which is available on all OS's. VLC is
    a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework that plays most multimedia files as
    well as DVD, Audio CD, VCD, and various streaming protocols. VLC can also play the videos at greater than
    1x speed by hitting the plus "+" key on the keypad. When playing videos at anything faster than 1x the
    sound will be automatically pitch corrected. For example, we like to watch Day9 and HuskyStarcraft videos
    at 2x.

    Always use the latest script version: Youtube changes the format of their HTML pages every once in a while
    which consequently breaks download scripts like what we have here. The average amount of time between HTML
    format changes is three(3) months. If you find this script no longer works make sure to check back on this
    page for any updates. We will do our best to keep this command line option working since we use this script
    at least once a day. Make note, at the top of the script we have the version number and date the script is
    good from. We will also post on the RSS feed (link at the top of the page) when a new version is available.



How can I extract sound from a video and make a mp3 or ogg ?

    At some point you will want to save off the sound from a video. A good case is downloading an instructional
    video and listening to it on your music player like a Sansa Clip, iPad, iPhone or iPod. We like to download
    class videos from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and listen to them in the car.

    You can use the above download script to get a video and convert the video's soundtrack to MP3 (or OGG or
    any other) format using avconv. You will need to install avconv in order to extract the audio. For Ubuntu
    use "apt-get install libav-tools". OpenBSD "pkg_add -i ffmpeg" and FreeBSD use "pkg_add -r ffmpeg" instead
    if avconv is not available as a package. For Mac OSX you may want to look at ffmpegX.

    ## Convert the audio from a Youtube video to mp3 or ogg, audio only.

    ## download the video. (Same link to Tobygames as above)
    user@machine$ ./youtube_get_videos.pl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejkm5uGoxs4
      Downloading:  radscorpion.flv

    ## Convert video to mp3, audio only
    user@machine$ avconv -i radscorpion.flv -vn -ab 128 toby_audio.mp3

    ## Convert video to ogg, audio only
    user@machine$ avconv -i radscorpion.flv -vn -ab 128 toby_audio.ogg




Questions?

How about an Android device app ?


    Yes, if you have an Android phone or tablet then check out the Android App - YouTube Downloader . You can
    even choose the format of the video from mp4, to avi to webm! Note: the app is not in the Google store yet,
    but you can download it directly from the sourceforge link we provided.

Is there a GUI or "clickable" download tool I can use ?


    The best Firefox add-on we have found is called Flash Video Downloader - Youtube Downloader by Pavel
    Shcherbakov . It is incredibly easy to use and offers multiple download formats and a choice of low,
    medium, high or HD quality. We use this add on all the time when it is easier to use Firefox then our perl
    script.

I have a patch or the script is broke

    You are welcome to mail us. Please make sure you look at any errors the script outputs to see if you can
    see the cause of the error. The contact link is at the bottom of this page.
